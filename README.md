# Janknerics

An alternative to built in generics. With a couple bonus features.

## Basics
Instead of writing:
```c#
class MyGeneric<T1, T2, T3, T4>
{
    public T1 P1;
    public required T2 P2 { get; init; }
    public T3 P3;
    public T4 P4;
}

class MyClassFloats: MyGeneric<float, float, int, string>;
class MyClassDoubles: MyGeneric<double, double, long, string>;
class MyClassAllInts : MyGeneric<int, int, int, int>;
```

Which is simple enough when there are not many types but...

With Janknerics we can write:

```c#
partial class MyClassDoubles;
partial class MyClassAllInts;

class MyModelClass
{
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassDoubles), NewType = typeof(double))]
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassAllInts), NewType = typeof(int))]
    public float P1;
    
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassDoubles), NewType = typeof(double))]
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassAllInts), NewType = typeof(int))]
    public float P2 { get; }
    
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassDoubles), NewType = typeof(long))]
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassAllInts), NewType = typeof(int))]
    public int P3;
    
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassDoubles), NewType = typeof(string))]
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassAllInts), NewType = typeof(int))]
    public string P4;
}
```

This takes more lines of code BUT it's much easier to follow when the number of type parameters gets large.

## Bonus Features
Since Janknerics is a Source Generator we can make it a little more useful than plain Generics too.

### Properties can be omitted entirely or "passed through" exactly.

In the example above for the ```P4``` field we could have written:

```c#
    [Jankneric(typeof(MyClassDoubles))]
    public string P4;
```

In this case:
* ```MyClassDoubles``` will have
  * ```public string P4;``` (just like ```MyModelClass```)
* ```MyClassAllInts```
  * will not have a ```P4``` at all.

### Constructors can be optionally autogenerated

In the example above the attributes on ```MyModelClass``` could have been specified this way:

```c#
[JanknericConstructor(typeof(MyClassDoubles))]
[JanknericConstructor(typeof(MyClassAllInts))]
class MyModelClass
```

In this case:
* ```MyClassDoubles``` gets a constructor that takes a ```MyModelClass``` argument.
  * each Property in ```MyClassDoubles``` will be constructed (and/or initialized?) with the corresponding property in ```MyModelClass```
* ```MyClassAllInts``` gets a constructor that takes a ```MyClassDoubles``` argument.
    * each Property in ```MyClassAllInts``` will be constructed (and/or initialized?) with the corresponding property in ```MyClassDoubles```
